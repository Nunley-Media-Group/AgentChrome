Feature: Dialog info and handle work correctly for open dialogs
  The dialog info command previously returned type "unknown" and message ""
  for open dialogs because CDP events are ephemeral and cannot be replayed
  to new sessions. The dialog handle command failed with "No dialog is
  currently open" because Page.enable blocks when a dialog is present.
  Both were fixed by a cookie-based interceptor that stores dialog metadata
  before calling the native dialog function, plus a Page.navigate fallback
  for dismissing pre-existing dialogs when Page.handleJavaScriptDialog fails.
  This fix also resolves #135 (dialog handle no-dialog-open error).

  Background:
    Given agentchrome is built

  # --- Bug Is Fixed ---

  @regression
  Scenario: AC1 — dialog info returns correct type and message for alert
    Given a page has triggered an alert dialog with message "hello"
    When I run "agentchrome dialog info"
    Then the output JSON should contain "open" equal to true
    And the output JSON should contain "type" equal to "alert"
    And the output JSON should contain "message" equal to "hello"
    And the exit code should be 0

  @regression
  Scenario: AC2 — dialog info reports confirm dialogs correctly
    Given a page has triggered a confirm dialog with message "proceed?"
    When I run "agentchrome dialog info"
    Then the output JSON should contain "open" equal to true
    And the output JSON should contain "type" equal to "confirm"
    And the output JSON should contain "message" equal to "proceed?"
    And the exit code should be 0

  @regression
  Scenario: AC4 — dialog handle returns correct type and message
    Given a page has triggered an alert dialog with message "test"
    When I run "agentchrome dialog handle accept"
    Then the output JSON should contain "dialog_type" equal to "alert"
    And the output JSON should contain "message" equal to "test"
    And the exit code should be 0

  @regression
  Scenario: AC5 — dialog handle dismisses pre-existing dialogs
    Given a page has triggered an alert dialog with message "test"
    And the dialog was opened before the current CLI invocation
    When I run "agentchrome dialog handle accept"
    Then the exit code should be 0

  # --- Related Behavior Still Works ---

  @regression
  Scenario: AC3 — dialog info still works when no dialog is open
    Given no dialog is currently open
    When I run "agentchrome dialog info"
    Then the output JSON should contain "open" equal to false
    And the exit code should be 0

  @regression
  Scenario: AC6 — dialog handle returns error when no dialog is open
    Given no dialog is currently open
    When I run "agentchrome dialog handle accept"
    Then the output should contain "No dialog is currently open"
    And the exit code should be non-zero
